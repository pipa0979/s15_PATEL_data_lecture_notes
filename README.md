"Data modelling is 'wicked hard'"- 
in a big data system, it becomes very hard and time consuming/expensive etc... however doable
If we write data in the wrong format, we have terabyte of data in the wrong format, now we need to invent months of time to get it right.


Where is the data coming from. 
IS the data clean?
if its not, trigger batch job that does the cleaning and then store it again.
Twitter delivers data in json format and handing in json parsers.
The most used twitter clients is the webbrowser . 

Twitter uses utf -8 and not use ascii because it allows to use more characters around the world.

Data lifecycle:
It starts with collection
-generatiion: data generated via sensors etcc...
Cleanup
Storage
Processing/analysis
qwery/visulaization/act

How do we start collecting data?
Curation: collect data
TRiage


Interation with big data:
Web interfacr (google)


Careful design in request response cycles
